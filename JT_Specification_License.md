The general idea of using an interchange format for electronic documents is in the public domain.
Anyone is free to devise a set of unique data structures and operators that define an interchange format for electronic documents.
However, UGS Corp. owns the copyright for the particular data structures and operators, the JTTM Data Format Reference and the written specification constituting the interchange format called the JT Data Format.
Thus, these elements of the JT Data Format may not be copied without UGS’s permission.
UGS will enforce its copyright. UGS’s intention is to maintain the integrity of the JT Data Format standard,
enabling the public to distinguish between the JT Data Format and other interchange formats for electronic documents.
However, UGS desires to promote the use of the JT Data Format for information interchange among diverse products and applications.

Accordingly, UGS gives anyone copyright permission, subject to the conditions stated below, to:
• Prepare and distribute files whose content conforms solely to the JT Data Format.
• Write and distribute software applications that produce discreet output represented in the JT Data Format.
Write and distribute software applications that accept input in the form of the JT Data
Format and display, print, or otherwise interpret the contents
• Copy UGS’s copyrighted list of data structures and operators in the written specification to the extent
necessary to use the JT Data Format for the purposes above.
• For avoidance of doubt, the permissions granted in the preceding sentences do not include the reading,
writing or distribution of files whose content contains output in the JT Data Format and any other data in any other format
and do not include the right to incorporate, integrate, or combine the JT Data Format, structure, or schema into any other data format, structure, or schema.

The conditions of such copyright permission are:
• Anyone who uses the copyrighted list of data structures and operators, as stated above, must include an appropriate copyright notice.
This limited right to use the copyrighted list of data structures and operators does not include the right to copy this document, other copyrighted material
from UGS, or the software in any of UGS’s products that use the JT Data Format, in whole or in part, nor does it include the right to use any UGS patents,
except as may be permitted by an official UGS JT Data Format Reference Patent Clarification Notice.
